1). We, (Isaiah, Tim, and Tom) managed to complete all the steps and did exactly what they told us to do
2). To verify that everything works, run the simulator with this code here and Enter after the SHELL> prompt, either type in "dir", "del filename","copy filename1 filename2", "create filename", or finally, "type filename". The text "filename" can be your choice.
3). dir should list all of the files in our OS at the moment after compiling. del should remove a file from the OS, but you can recover stuff in there like messag or tstpr1 or tstpr2 by simply recompiling the program. Copy should take the first file name you entered and store all of its contents into the new second filename you entered. Create should continuously prompt you for lines to enter in until you enter in a blank line, and then create a new file with the name you specified that will print out the messages you entered into it. And Now Finally, Type should simply print out the contents of any file name you provided, given that it has text in it in the first place!
